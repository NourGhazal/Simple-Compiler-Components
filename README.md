# Task 1:
In this task DFA simulation was implemented.
The DFA is created using the following convention:
0,0,1;1,2,1;2,0,3;3,3,3#1,3
- Each state is separated using ;   
- The state definition is separated using ,
- The first number in each state is the state number, the second number is the zero transitions and the third and final number is the one transition 
- After the # is the accept states of the DFA separated by ,

For simplicity the alphabet is considered to be consisting of 0 or 1 only.
